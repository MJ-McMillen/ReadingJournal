    "### Dictionaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **dictionary** is like a list, but more general. In a list, the indicies are always interagers but in a dictionary, they can be almost any type. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of a dicitonary as a mapping betweeen a set of indicies (which are called **keys**)\n",
    "\n",
    "A value and a key are called an **item** or sometimes a **key-value-pair**\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `dict` creates a **new dictionary** because its a built in function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The squigley brackets **{}** represent an empty dicitonary. To add items to a dictionary you can use square brackets. ex: eng2sp ['one'] = 'uno'\n",
    "print eng2sp {'one':'uno'} \n",
    "\n",
    "The **Order of dictionary elements is random** Dictionary elements are never indexed on an interager so there is no correct order. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the key is not in the dictionary, you get a **KeyError**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Len function works with dicitonaries. It returns the number of key-value pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a magic **hashtable** in python so that the in p[erator takes about the same time on any sized list. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.1 Dictionary as a set of counters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ex. I am given a string and I want to count how many times each letter appears. There is an easy way to do this with dictionaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "I can create a dictionary with characters as the items and counters as the corresponding values. Every time I see  a character I would add it to the dictionary after that I would incriment the exsisitng items. \n",
    "ex:\n",
    "``` def histogram(s):\n",
    "        d = dict()\n",
    "        for c in s:\n",
    "        if c not in d:\n",
    "            d[c] = 1\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            d[c] += 1\n",
    "      return d\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.2 Looping and dictionaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can loop printing an element of a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reverse lookup . \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.4 dictionaries and Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists can appear as values in a dicitonary \n",
    "\n",
    "A **Singleton** is a list that contains a single element. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **Has** is a function that takes a value (of any kind) and return an interagure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionaries use these has values to store, and look up key-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11.5 Memos\n",
    "\n",
    "A **call graph** shows a set of funtion frames with lines connecting each frames to the frames of the function it calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **memo** is a memorized stored alue of a previously computed function. It can be very helpful when doing long computaitons.\n",

    "What is the longest English word, that remains a valid English word, as you remove its letters one at a time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, letters can be removed from either end, or the middle, but you can’t rearrange any of the letters. Every time you drop a letter, you wind up with another English word. If you do that, you’re eventually going to wind up with one letter and that too is going to be an English word—one that’s found in the dictionary. I want to know what’s the longest word and how many letters does it have?\n",

    "I’m going to give you a little modest example: Sprite. Ok? You start off with sprite, you take a letter off, one from the interior of the word, take the r away, and we’re left with the word spite, then we take the e off the end, we’re left with spit, we take the s off, we’re left with pit, it, and I. \n",

    "- Recursively, a word is reducible if any of its children are reducible. As a base case, you can consider the empty string reducible.\n",
    "- The word list from [Chapter 9.1](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2010.html) Exercise 1 doesn’t contain single letter words. So you might want to add “I”, “a”, and the empty string.\n",
