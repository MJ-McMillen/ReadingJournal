    "\n",
    "An **Augmented Assignment Statement** can help update a variable easily. For example `total += x` is the same as `total = total +x`\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Accumulator** is a variable that adds up all the elements. I like using accumulators. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a built in sum function. It reduces all elements in a list into one thing,\n",
    "\n",
    "A **map function** maps the operation onto every element of a list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another list thing is the creation of sublist. \n",

    "### 10.8 Deleteing elements\n",
    " \n",
    " The **pop** thing deletes an element and returns the deleted element\n",
    " \n",
    " You can also use **del** if you do not need the deleted value returned.\n",
    " \n",
    " If you know the value you want to remove but not the index, you can use the remove \n",
    " \n",
    " ###10.9 Lists and Strings \n",
    " \n",
    " ** Do not use list as a variable name because it is a built in function**\n",
    " \n",
    " You can turn a string filled with elements into a list by using the delimiter. You can split on a common delimiter and split the string into list elements. This is like how csvs use , as delimiters. \n",
    " \n",
    " join is the inverse of split. \n",
