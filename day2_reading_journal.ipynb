    "### 6.1 Return Values\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling a **fruitful function** produces a return value\n",
    "\n",
    "Calling a **void function** produces no return value/ NONE is their return. \n",
    "\n",
    "As soon as a **return statememnt** runs, the funciton is terminated without executing any subsequent statement. Any place after a return statement is called **dead code**\n",
    "\n",
    "Its a good idea in a fruitful function to have every possible path end in a return.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.2 Incremental development. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Incremental development** avoids long debugging by adding small bits of code each time and testing them along the way. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Print** statements are useful in debugging to check what is happening within a funciton along the way. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.3 Composition. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can call one function from within another. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.4 Boolean functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can return booleans, which is often convinent for hiding complicated tests in side finctions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.5 Recursive functions\n",
    "\n",
    "you can recurse functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.6 Leap of faith. \n",
    "\n",
    "when you come to a function call, instead of following the flow of execution, assume that the function works correctly and returns the right result. \n",
    "\n",
    "The same is true of recursive functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "We already do this with built in functions. "
